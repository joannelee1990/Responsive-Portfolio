      <p>My name is Joanne and I have a puppy named Potato. My favorite food, coincidentally 
        (but not really), is <em>also</em> potatoes. Generally speaking though, I am a lover 
        of all foods. I even went to school to become a chef but soon realized that I wasn't interested 
        in the act of cooking so much as the act of eating.</p>
      <p>I like to take long walks at grocery stores and binge eat at Indian lunch buffets when life stresses 
        me out. I enjoy all forms of art especially literature and I secretly dream of living in Italy writing books
        and drinking wine (maybe beer from time to time, no, who am I kidding. <u>Beer all the time</u>) for 
        the rest of my life.
